This is one of the animals tales for kids to read. Once upon a time in a forest,
 there lived a lion. Now, this lion was the king of the forest. Because of that, 
 the lion had grown too proud of his strength. He would go about thinking nobody
 could beat him.
  One day, after a meal he decided to take a quick nap. After finding 
a tree with good shade, he yawned and stretched. He saw a mosquito buzzing by.
“Oh, how glad I am to be a lion. Unlike these mosquitoes I am strong. 
These mosquitos are so small and easy to crush. And that is why they keep running away,”
 he lay down muttering that. Also, read The Lion In Love.
